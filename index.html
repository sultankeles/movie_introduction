        <p>Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an exceptionally skilled thief. His expertise lies in extracting valuable secrets from the depths of the subconscious during the most vulnerable moment of the mind – in the act of dreaming – and stealing them. Cobb's rare talent has made him a sought-after player in the dangerous new world of corporate espionage. However, it has also turned him into an international fugitive and cost him everything he loves.<br>

            Cobb is offered a chance to escape his current predicament. He is presented with one last job that could give him his life back, but only if he can pull off the impossible "inception." Instead of executing a perfect heist, Cobb and his team of professionals must do the opposite: their mission is not to steal an idea but to plant one. If they succeed, it will be the perfect crime.<br>
            
            However, meticulous planning and expertise alone cannot prepare them for their dangerous adversaries, who seem to anticipate their every move. This is an adversary whose arrival only Cobb can foresee.
            <br>
            The crime scene is your mind.</p>
